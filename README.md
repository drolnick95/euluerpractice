My attempts at solving some of the Euler Project problems in python

For most of my solutions, I have used a command line argument to feed the program the desired criteria. For example, the first problem which sums the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 would be run by typing:
    
    python multiples35.py 1000
    
To get the sum of multiples below 10, type:

    python multiples35.py 10
  
This made it easier to test my solutions against the provided examples and expand the functionality a little.
